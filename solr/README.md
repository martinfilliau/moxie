# Solr

## Solr schema

The solr schema needs to be generated by using the following command:

    python manage.py build_solr_schema --settings=talks.local_settings > solr/schema.xml

Every time the `search_indexes.py` files are modified, the `build_solr_schema` command
should be used so that we always have the latest version of the schema in Solr.

## Development

### Using fig

Just type at the root of the repository:

    fig up solr

### Using docker

Just type at the root of the repository:

    docker build -t talks-solr .

    docker run -d -p 8983:8983 talks-solr

### Using your own installation of Solr

The ``solrconfig.xml`` file is available in the ``solr`` directory at the root of the repository.

Both files (``schema.xml`` and ``solrconfig.xml``) need to be put in your core's (default is ``collection1``) ``conf`` directory.
